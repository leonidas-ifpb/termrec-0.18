0.17
* Support for 256 colour codes.
* .xz support.
* Major portability/bit rot fixes.
* Assorted fixes.

0.16
* --append
* Protocols: tcp:// (rw), telnet:// (r), termcast:// (r).

0.15
* A total reorganization, with refactoring of most parts.
* Library.
* New utilities: termcat and termtime.
* Unix termplay is finally usable.
* Loading the data in a background thread actually works (not on win32).
* proxyrec defaults to --raw and -f ansi.
* Bugfixes in vt100 interpretation.
* New format: DosRecorder (read-only).

0.14
* Moved win32 crap to a dir on its own.
* proxyrec: IPv6 support for outgoing connections.
* If you specify a format, you need to append requested compression type
  to it (like, .nh.gz).  This allows disabling compression, before it was
  always .bz2 unless a file name was explicitely set.

0.13
* New format: RealLogs (write-only).

0.12
* termplay/win32: exporting a part of a replay.

0.11
* Fixed a race condition in termplay/win32 that often caused crashes if the
  file to replay was specified on the command line.
* Done proxyrec/unix -- it's untested on anything but Debian/unstable/i386,
  though.
* Made some preliminary code for termrec/unix.  It's still buggy.
